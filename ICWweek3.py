# Problem 1:
#
# Given a number n, return True if n is in the range 1..10, inclusive.
# Unless outside_mode is True, in which case return True if the number is less or equal to 1, or greater or equal to 10.
# Print the result returned from your function.
#
# BONUS: Get the number and outside_mode flag from User input instead of hardcoding it
#
# def in1to10(n, outside_mode):
#
# Examples of Expected Output:
#
# in1to10(5, False) â†’ True
#
# in1to10(11, False) â†’ False
#
# in1to10(11, True) â†’ True
